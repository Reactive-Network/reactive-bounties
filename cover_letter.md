## Bounty Application
I am applying for the Reactive Smart Contract bounty with the implementation of a `MultiPartyWallet` smart contract. This contract enables efficient fund distribution among multiple shareholders, with both ETH and ERC20 token support.

## Explanation
Reactive Smart Contracts solve the problem of automated and transparent fund distribution, which is difficult to achieve without such automation. This implementation provides a robust solution for managing multiple shareholders and distributing funds based on their shares.

## Repository Overview
The repository includes:
- The Reactive Smart Contract (`MultiPartyWallet.sol`)
- Deployment scripts
- Detailed instructions
- Workflow descriptions and transaction hashes

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Maheswaran Velmurugan
