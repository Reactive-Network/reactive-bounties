## Bounty

Automated Funds Distribution â€” 400

## Submission Overview

My submission consists of:

1. A MultiPartyWallet contract deployed on Sepolia
2. A MemeCoin ERC20 contract deployed on Sepolia
3. A MultiPartyWalletReactive contract deployed on the Reactive Network(KOPLI)
4. Comprehensive workflow documentation
5. All necessary deploy scripts and instructions

The implementation fulfills all requirements specified in the bounty description, showcasing the power of Reactive Smart Contracts in handling cross-chain functionality and event-driven actions.

## Key Features

- Secure multi-party contribution and fund distribution
- Reactive updates to shares and fund distribution
- Integration with a custom ERC20 token (MemeCoin)
- Comprehensive event system for triggering reactive actions

## The Power of Reactive Smart Contracts in Our Implementation

Reactive Smart Contracts play a crucial role in our Multi-Party Wallet implementation:

1. **Automated Share Updates**: When the wallet is closed (Step 5), the Reactive contract detects the WalletClosed event and automatically triggers the updateShares function (Step 6). This ensures that all shareholder stakes are accurately calculated without manual intervention.

2. **Efficient Fund Distribution**: Upon receiving additional funds (Step 7), the Reactive contract detects the FundsReceived event and automatically calls the distributeAllFunds function (Step 8). This automates the distribution process, ensuring prompt and fair allocation of funds and MemeCoin to all shareholders.

3. **Dynamic Shareholder Management**: When a shareholder leaves (Step 9), the Reactive contract detects the ShareholderLeft event and automatically recalculates shares for the remaining shareholders (Step 10). This maintains an up-to-date and accurate representation of ownership without requiring manual updates.

4. **Cross-Chain Communication**: The Reactive contract seamlessly bridges the Sepolia and Reactive networks, allowing events on Sepolia to trigger actions on the Reactive network. This cross-chain functionality is essential for the wallet's automated features.

5. **Event-Driven Architecture**: By leveraging Reactive's event listening capabilities, our implementation responds in real-time to critical wallet events (wallet closure, fund receipt, shareholder departure), ensuring the wallet state remains consistent and up-to-date across both networks.

Without Reactive Smart Contracts, achieving this level of automation and cross-chain functionality would require significantly more complex code and manual processes, potentially introducing delays and errors. Reactive has enabled us to create a more efficient, responsive, and user-friendly Multi-Party Wallet.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm excited about the possibilities that Reactive Smart Contracts have opened up in this implementation and look forward to your feedback. I'm available to answer any questions or provide additional information as needed.

Best regards,
Prakhar Srivastava
